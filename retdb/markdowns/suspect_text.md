On this page, you can see retention times (RTs) that were flagged as suspicious by the system.
 <br />
RTs are flagged if they appear to be heavily diverging from the general pattern in one of the models build between chromatographic systems. This would mean that the RT is probably wrong in one of the systems. 
<br />
If the RT is only flagged in one model, it is not possible to know which RT is wrong. Therefore, you will find below values that are for sure correct. If a compound was flagged in several systems, PredRet tries to determine which RT is incorrect and only flags that RT.
