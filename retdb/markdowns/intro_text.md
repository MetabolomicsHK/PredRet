This tool consist of four parts:

 1. Uploading your data.
 2. Adding a description of your chromatographic setup to associate with your retention time data.
 3. Managing your data: inspecting the data you have have uploaded and deleting data.
 4. **Get predictions**. Here you can predict what the retention should be for compounds you have not analyzed youself but others have analyzed in their own chromatographic system.
