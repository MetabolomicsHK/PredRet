**Welcome to the RetPred tool.**


This tool will allow you to upload your own retention time data for compounds analyzed in your own setup and predict the retention time of compounds others have analyzed in their unique setup.
<br />
<br />

This tool consist of four parts:

 1. Uploading your data.
 2. Adding a description of your chromatographic setup to associate with your retention time data.
 3. Managing your data: inspecting the data you have have uploaded and deleting data.
 4. **Get predictions**. Here you can predict what the retention should be for compounds you have not analyzed youself but others have analyzed in their own chromatographic system.

Please be aware that because calculation of the predictions is a time-consuming process they are performed on a schedule. Therefore it can take up to 30 minutes for predictions to be available.
